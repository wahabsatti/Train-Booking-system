Overview: The train management system is a console-based application designed to facilitate booking a train ticket, editing the data, and the management of records. It interacts with users through a text-based interface and maintains persistent records using file operations. Key Components: Libraries and Constants • Libraries: The system leverages several C++ standard libraries for input/output operations, file handling, console management, and functions.      <Windows.h> • Compiler: VISUAL STUDIO Global Variables: • File Streams: o Personal details: Stores user personal details such as name, cnic, dob. o Booking history: Stores user booking history like destination, departure, seat type. Data Structures: • Record Structure: A struct record represents user’s record with name, cnic, dob, etc Functionality Overview: Main Function: The main function serves as the entry point of the application, performing the following tasks:

DISPLAY FRONT PAGE (void pattern): Presents a welcome screen to the user.
BOOK A TICKET (int BookaTicket): Take the input from user for desired sections  Name  Cnic  Dob ,etc
VIEW RECORD (void viewrecord): Shows the record that user has entered
EDIT RECORD (int editrecord): User can edit the record if he wants to change anything.
PRINT TICKET (int printTicket): Prints the ticket.
VIEW ALL RECORDS (void view_allRecords): Shows all record using the user name and password.
DISPLAY FRONT PAGE (void pattern) Purpose: Presents a welcome screen to the user. • This function displays a welcoming message or banner when the user starts the program. • It sets a positive tone for the user experience and serves as the initial interaction point.
BOOK A TICKET (int BookaTicket) Purpose: Takes input from the user for desired sections such as Name, CNIC, and DOB. • This function collects essential details from the user required to book a ticket. • It typically prompts the user to enter their name, CNIC (a unique identification number), date of birth, and other necessary information. • The collected data is stored for further processing.
VIEW RECORD (void viewrecord) Purpose: Shows the record that the user has entered. • This function displays the details of the ticket that the user has provided. • It allows the user to review the information they have entered to ensure it is correct. • The information presented includes fields like name, CNIC, and date of birth.
EDIT RECORD (int editrecord) Purpose: Allows the user to edit the record if they want to change any information. • This function provides options for the user to modify specific fields of their ticket details. • It prompts the user to choose which piece of information they would like to edit (e.g., name, CNIC, DOB). • After selecting an option, the user can input the new information, which updates the record.
PRINT TICKET (int printTicket) Purpose: Prints the ticket. • This function displays the complete ticket details in a formatted manner. • It is usually called after the user has entered all necessary information and is ready to finalize the ticket. • The ticket details are printed in a clear, organized format, often including a decorative banner or borders.
VIEW ALL RECORDS (void view_allRecords) Purpose: Shows all records using the user name and password. • This function displays all the tickets stored in the system. • It typically requires authentication (e.g., username and password) to ensure that only authorized users can access this information. • Once authenticated, the function lists all the tickets with their respective details, allowing the user to view every record in the system
Strengths of the Train Management System: Effective Management: • Efficient Booking and Editing: The system efficiently handles the booking of train tickets and allows users to edit their details if needed. • Detailed Record Keeping: It maintains accurate records of user information and ticket details, ensuring that all data is up-to-date and accessible. Data Persistence: • Persistent Storage: Ensures that user details and booking history are persistently stored using file operations. • Reliable Data Retrieval: The system can retrieve and display all records accurately, providing users with a reliable history of their bookings. • File Handling: Utilizes file handling techniques to read from and write to files, ensuring data is saved between sessions and can be accessed at any time. User-Friendly Interface: • Clear and Simple Interaction: Offers a straightforward, text-based interface that is easy for users to navigate. • Guided User Experience: Guides users through each step of booking, viewing, editing, and printing tickets, minimizing the possibility of errors. • Error Correction: Allows users to correct information at each point if they enter wrong data, ensuring accuracy and reducing frustration. • Use of Color Codes: Enhances the user interface with color codes to highlight important information, errors, and successful actions, making the interaction more intuitive and visually appealing Modular Design: • Function Segregation: Segregates different functionalities such as booking tickets, viewing records, editing records, printing tickets, and viewing all records into specific functions. • Enhanced Maintainability: The modular design enhances the maintainability of the system, making it easier to update and extend. • Readability: Improves readability of the code, allowing developers to understand and modify individual parts of the system without affecting others. Use of Structures: • Structured Data Management: Utilizes data structures (e.g., structs) to systematically organize and manage user data and booking records. • Clear Data Representation: Structures provide a clear representation of user details and ticket information, enhancing code clarity and maintenance. Use of File Handling: • Efficient Data Operations: Provides efficient mechanisms for reading from and writing to files, ensuring quick data access and updates. • Data Integrity: Enhances data integrity by using file handling techniques to prevent data loss and ensure consistent storage. • Persistent Data Storage: Ensures that user data and booking records are persistently stored and easily retrievable, even after the program is closed and reopened.
